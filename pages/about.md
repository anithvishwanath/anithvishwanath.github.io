Hi, I'm Anith. I'm an experience designer focused on creating effortless, customer focused experiences. 

I am currently working as a UX/UI Designer at NCR Corporation. Take a look at my <a href="/">projects</a> to see what I've worked on.

While I am not designing, I love to travel, read a lot of books, write (blog coming soon!), and learn new languages. I am currently (self)-learning Swedish. My interests include AR/VR, 3D + VFX, and generative/procedural art.
