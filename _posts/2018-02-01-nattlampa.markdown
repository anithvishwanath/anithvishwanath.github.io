First of all, my Swedish is _very_ rusty so apologies if the name “Nattlampa” doesn’t translate very well to “Night light”. The design’s working title was “Nocturne” but I have a fascination with Swedish culture, so I decided to name it Nattlampa!

I’ve been reading various papers on how wildlife is affected by artificial night-time lighting. This isn’t just limited to wildlife as humans are also equally affected by street lights. For instance, human sleep patterns may be affected, or even bird migration patterns. I have occasionally seen confused birds in the night — disorientated perhaps — because of bright night-time lighting. This paper gave me an idea of designing an app that measures the effects of nocturnal lighting on wildlife.

My design process started by rough conceptualising followed by a mind map to quickly identify the requirements.

1. The user could point their phones to the source and take a picture. The app would then analyse the type of light and give out the results of the analysis.
2. The results would primarily include the type of lamp used in the light source, its effects on the wildlife, and a short description — all at a glance. [More technical information can also be seen, if the user wishes to.]
3. Finally, the user will also be able to send or share their results to contacts or on social media.

After getting a rough idea, I built a persona centred around the requirements:

Once I identified and conceptualised the requirements, I built a rough draft of a prototype on paper, which also served as a storyboard. I wanted the app to provide a good onboarding experience to the user so they feel engaged. I began by drawing three primary screens: the splash, camera, and the result. The image below shows my sketch:

With these basic requirements in mind along with a semi-concrete concept, I started the prototype design. I chose Figma because it’s free (and I am broke, to be honest), and it also provides some drafts to begin with. I decided to use Google’s material design as the basis for my app design because I love their design philosophy (inspired by the study of paper and ink). For those unaware, have a look at this insightful video. I love how everything appears stacked upon each other; it does feel like paper, and also fluid like ink. Very fitting indeed.

The mockup took me two days because I was simultaneously studying up on Material Design do’s and dont’s. I decided to show the results on a Card because it shows enough information to the user at a glance. The user can then choose to view more information or share the results with their friends/colleagues. I was also thinking of placing a call to action button encouraging them to take a new picture and it is all an iterative process. I’ll be adding more screens once I expand upon the idea. I’ve uploaded two of the frames on dribbble here. (I made a vow I’ll upload something in January and I am glad I did!)
