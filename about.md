Hi, I'm Anith. Thank you for visiting my website. I'm an experience designer focused on creating effortless, customer focused experiences. 

I am currently working as a UX/UI Designer at <a href="https://www.ncr.com/" target="_blank">NCR Corporation</a>. Take a look at my past <a href="/">projects</a> to see what I've worked on.

While I am not designing, I love to travel, read a lot of books, write (blog coming soon!), and learn new languages -- I am currently (self-)learning Swedish! I am very keen on learning and crafting experiences for 3D, generative/procedural, and mixed reality spaces.
